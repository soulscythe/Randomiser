Form should have various 'view' options,
    firstly a 'social' view, showing {name, race, appearance basics, occupation, simple personality traits, maybe social skills}.
    secondly, a 'combat' view, showing the relevant attack bonuses, weapons, stats and so on.
    thirdly, a 'detailed' view, showing all the possible info available.

Occupations list can also be used for hobbies, one might be a fisherman, with a hobby of wood carving.

'Place of occupation' may need to be accounted for somehow...

Certain occupations are specific to certain ages or genders. This may have to be accounted for.
